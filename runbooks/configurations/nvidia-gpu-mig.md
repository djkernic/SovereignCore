# Configuring Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) for NVIDIA GPUs

## Introduction

The Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) feature, available on supported NVIDIA GPUs, allows GPUs to be securely partitioned into instances.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure the NVIDIA GPU hardware is the Ampere generation or a later generation. For details, see https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/mig-user-guide/supported-gpus.html

This document describes how a system owner configures this feature in the AI inference service.

## Prerequisites

- You must have the System owner role in the account with access to the credentials to log in to the management cluster where IBM Sovereign Core is installed.
- The platform account owner must create the shared cluster for the AI inference service with the GPU operator installed.
- Remove all foundation model pods from the cluster. You cannot partition GPUs while model deployments are active.

## About the strategy

NVIDIA MIG provides single (homogeneous) and mixed (heterogeneous) advertisement strategies.

You have the following options when you configure NVIDIA MIG:

### Single strategy

You can use the same profile on all of the GPU worker nodes in your cluster. All worker nodes are identified in the custom resource for the deployed model as a separate resource as a single generic GPU resource called nvidia.com/gpu. Kubernetes treats all slices as equivalent and does not distinguish between MIG sizes.
For example, the deployed model's custom resource contains the following section:

```yaml
kind: ModelDeployment
...
            resources:
            limits:
                nvidia.com/gpu: 1
...
```

### Mixed strategy

You can use different profiles on each worker node in your cluster. Each profile is identified in the custom resource for the deployed model as a separate resource, such as nvidia.com/mig-1g.5gb. Kubernetes can schedule workloads based on specific MIG sizes.

> [!CAUTION]
> The IBM Sovereign Core UI does not support resource notation for the mixed strategy. If you set the mixed strategy, you cannot deploy models from the UI and you must use the CLI instead.

For example, the deployed model's custom resource contains the following section:

```yaml
kind: ModelDeployment
...
            resources:
            limits:
                nvidia.com/mig-1g.5gb: 1
...
```

### Which to use

Use the **single strategy** for large clusters where you can organize nodes into groups with the same MIG profile. All GPUs on each node must use the same profile. This strategy works with existing model deployments without modification because they use the standard `nvidia.com/gpu` resource notation.

Use the **mixed strategy** for smaller clusters where you need different MIG profiles on the same node. Each GPU can use a different profile, but model deployments must specify the exact profile they need (such as `nvidia.com/mig-1g.5gb`) in their resource notation.

Review [MIG support in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/openshift/latest/mig-ocp.html) in the NVIDIA documentation for more information about advertisement strategies and MIG profiles.

## Procedure

1. Get the Kubernetes context of the AI inference service cluster where the Nvidia GPU Operator is installed. For details, see the [Kubernetes reference documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/configure-access-multiple-clusters/).
    - To find the name of the cluster, run `oc get managedcluster -l sovcloud.open-cluster-management.io/nvidia-gpu=true`

2. Review the supported MIG profiles to choose the profile you want to configure. For details, see [Supported MIG profiles](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/mig-user-guide/supported-mig-profiles.html).
    Run the following command to view the default profiles configured in the service cluster:

    ```sh
    oc get cm --context "<ai-inference-cluster-context>" \
    -n nvidia-gpu-operator default-mig-parted-config \
    -o go-template='{{index .data "config.yaml"}}'

3. Set the NVIDIA MIG strategy. The strategy is managed by the `nvidia-gpu-configuration` policy on the management cluster.
     1. From the management cluster, check the existing MIG strategy by running the following command:

        ```sh
        oc get policy -n openshift-acm-policies nvidia-gpu-configuration -o yaml
        ```

     2. To change the strategy, update the strategy field of the gpu-cluster-policy object.
     In the following example, the path assumes that `gpu-cluster-policy` is defined at position 4 (0-based index) of the object-templates array. Verify the correct index for your environment before running the command by checking the output of step 1.
     Replace new-strategy with either single or mixed.

        ```sh
        oc patch policy nvidia-gpu-configuration \
            -n openshift-acm-policies \
            --type=json \
            -p='[
            {
                "op": "replace",
                "path": "/spec/policy-templates/0/objectDefinition/spec/object-templates/3/objectDefinition/spec/mig/strategy",
                "value": "<new-strategy>"
            }
            ]'
        ```

4. Get the GPU capacity of each node by running the following command:

    ```sh
    oc get nodes --context "<ai-inference-cluster-context>" \
    -o jsonpath='{.items[*].status.capacity.nvidia\.com/gpu}'
    ```

    Select the node whose GPU you want to partition from the list.

5. Check whether a foundation model is deployed on the node by running the following command:

    ```sh
    oc get pod --context "<ai-inference-cluster-context>" -n llms -o wide
    ```

    The pods running in the llms namespace are listed with their node assignments. If a model deployment is running on the target node, delete the model deployment. MIG cannot be configured while model deployments are active on a node.

    ```

6. Set the MIG profile on the GPU node.
    Replace node-name with the target node name and profile-name with the selected profile.
    ```sh
    oc label node <node-name> nvidia.com/mig.config=<profile-name> --overwrite
    ```

7. Redeploy models if you removed them as part of this procedure.
